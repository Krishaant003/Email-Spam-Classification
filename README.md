# Email-Spam-Classification  
This project implements an email spam classifier using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The goal is to classify incoming emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham) based on their content and features extracted from the email data.  
  
# Model Used  
The spam classifier uses the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to make the final classification decision.  
  
To train the model, you can use the provided Email Spam Classification.ipynb script or customize it to fit your dataset and feature extraction process. 

# Accuracy[Tested]  
This model has an accuracy of 99% when tested using the given dataset[downloaded from Kaggle]    
Further,classification report and Confusion matrix are executed and shown in the Email Spam classification file
